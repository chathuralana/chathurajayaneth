This bird, a subspecies of the Indian peafowl, is characterized by the striking iridescence of its male, which boasts an array of vivid colors, including electric blues, greens, and shimmering metallic hues. The elongated and extravagant tail feathers, or \"train,\" adorned with iridescent \"eyes,\" are a spectacular display during courtship rituals."

        "text": "Male Sri Lankan peafowls, or peacocks, use their intricate plumage to attract mates during the breeding season, engaging in elaborate courtship dances. These displays involve the unfurling and shaking of the iridescent train, accompanied by vocalizations and posturing to impress and captivate peahens. In contrast, female peafowls, or peahens, have more subdued plumage, providing them with effective camouflage for nesting and rearing their chicks."
