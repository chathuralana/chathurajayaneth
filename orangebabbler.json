Characterized by its vibrant plumage and unique vocalizations, this babbler belongs to the Leiothrichidae family and is renowned for its social behavior within its close-knit groups. The bird's name aptly describes its striking feature - a conspicuous orange bill that contrasts with its predominantly brown and buff-colored feathers. The plumage features subtle variations among individuals, with a mottled appearance that aids in their adept camouflage within the dense undergrowth of the forests they inhabit."
