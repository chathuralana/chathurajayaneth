        "text": "Egg laying takes place in July, and clutch size is about 2-5 eggs, each measuring 7.6-8.1 by 13.5-14.5 mm (.31 by .55 inch). The eggs are deposited in a hole, and hatch after 81–90 days. However, hatchlings have been founded in the wild also during colder months such as December and January. Hatchlings which emerge from eggs laid in humus or among leaf litter can be observed frequently occupying the ground where dead branch sticks and leaf litter well camouflaged them from the possible predators."
