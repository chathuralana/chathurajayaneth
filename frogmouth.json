Known for its distinctive appearance and nocturnal habits, this bird belongs to the family Podargidae and is renowned for its remarkable camouflage, allowing it to blend seamlessly with the surroundings. The plumage of the Sri Lankan frogmouth features a mottled pattern of browns, grays, and blacks, resembling tree bark and providing exceptional camouflage against tree branches during daylight hours."

Their wide, gape-like mouths contribute to their name, emphasizing their insectivorous diet, which mainly consists of moths, beetles, and other nocturnal insects. The Sri Lankan frogmouth's cryptic appearance and behavior make it a challenging species to spot, even for experienced birdwatchers, as it remains motionless during the day, relying on its camouflage to escape detection."
