        "content": "The best time to visit Wilpattu National Park is during the dry season, which typically spans from late May to early October. This period ensures optimal conditions for wildlife viewing as the vegetation is less dense, making it easier to spot animals in their natural habitats. The months of June to September are particularly favorable, offering the driest and most pleasant weather for safari adventures. The scarcity of water sources during the dry season concentrates wildlife around the remaining lakes, enhancing the chances of encountering a variety of species, including the park's famous leopard population. However, it's important to note that the park may close during the monsoon season, usually from October to January, due to heavy rains and potential flooding. Therefore, planning a visit during the dry months ensures a more enjoyable and rewarding experience amidst the diverse landscapes and thriving wildlife of Wilpattu National Park."
