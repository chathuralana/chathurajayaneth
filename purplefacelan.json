        "text": "The Sri Lankan Purple-faced Langur (Semnopithecus vetulus) is an endemic primate species found exclusively in the lush tropical forests of Sri Lanka, making it an integral part of the island's unique biodiversity. Recognized for its striking appearance, the Purple-faced Langur exhibits a distinctive fur coloration ranging from dark brown to almost black, with a characteristic purple-blue face and strikingly long, tufted white or silver eyebrows. These langurs, also known as purple-faced leaf monkeys, are arboreal and predominantly herbivorous, with their diet consisting of leaves, fruits, flowers, and occasionally insects."

        "text": "Living in close-knit social groups, Purple-faced Langurs display intricate social structures, with females often forming the core of the group and males dispersing upon reaching maturity. Their complex social interactions involve grooming, vocalizations, and various facial expressions that contribute to group cohesion and communication. The species has adapted to a predominantly arboreal lifestyle, with remarkable agility in navigating through the forest canopy."
